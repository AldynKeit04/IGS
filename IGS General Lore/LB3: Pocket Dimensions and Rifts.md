Pocket Dimensions and Rifts
------------------------------
Pocket dimensions are essentially small realms that each of the IGS beings control. They, by default are an empty copy of the primary IGS realm, but they can be changed to the liking of the rulers, and can even be realms that are much more familiar to humans, with planets and life and all those sorts. There are also rifts, which are essentially other pocket dimensions that are used for various purposes (IRL/server lore, they are our Minecraft worlds/realms). In many of these rifts/realms, there are groups of these simple red geometric creatures, which serve many purposes (server lore/IRL, they are villagers, and the following is essentially an explanation for us making cities and stuff in Minecraft), and are much more simple. They essentially just move around in space, live, and do things that feed the main creator of the rift resources and power. The rulers and main creators of these rifts often gather together and "breed" these simple creatures to grow their power and for more of these services. Not all rifts are like this, such as the "2" realm, belonging to the original bfatsoo, which is a sandbox for all of the Entigons to do anything they want.

Lavagons
----------------------
A portal in the middle of IGS space appeared, out came some ships. These ships look very similar to the 'gon ships, however they are bright and varied in colors. They also have a pattern that is constantly moving, which are blobs that are a contrasting but fitting color. These ships land on a random piece of geometry, and out comes essentially what are much smoother looking Wiregons, which have the same moving pattern, like a lava lamp. These Lavagons set up shop on a green dodecahedron, which they begin converting into having the same lava lamp pattern, the colors being specifically purple with red moving lava blobs. They also begin enslaving and killing the 'gons which are on this planet. They are somewhat smarter than sentient 'gons, and they can do more complex things and are capable of making better choices, as well as making better weapons, and land vehicles. They also enslave both sentient and non-sentient 'gons.

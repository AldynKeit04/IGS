The Beings of IGS and the Stadthalder

The main realm that exists within this universe is IGS. IGS is an infinite void filled with random geometric shapes, think as if you were floating through the Smash Melee menu screen. This void exists in a different plane to our world, and is totally disconnected from it, and within this plane of existence this world exists on an extremely high dimension, although most of the random shapes exist within the third dimension. Each of the beings within this universe are sentient, incomprehensible shapes that exist within all these different sorts of dimensions within this plane. If a human looked at one of these beings, they would just see a mass of blurs and dots that are constantly moving. They can communicate with each other, however it is also not comprehensible how, as these shapes don't work like humans. They don't have biology like humans. These beings have god like powers in IGS, well, to them it's normal and not godlike. They can do all sorts of things, but the Stadthalder is has the most power over anything, even the power to make other beings instantly stop existing, as well as their pocket dimensions. He could completely change how the entire realm looks, and functions. These beings can also change forms into anything they want, which can be more or less comprehensible to humans (the bfatsoo hivemind being a good example of a comprehensible form).

A New Rift
-------------------------------------
A rift portal opens up in the main area of IGS space. This portal leads to an unnamed medieval kingdom. When Entigons enter it, they become translucent. The people in this world cannot see or notice the Entigons, however they can very slightly manipulate it and spawn very small things. This rift also seems to have some time irregularities, sometimes time skips back a few minutes, and at least one being in it came from a different era, or perhaps even universe entirely. As of now, it seems as if the Kingdom is ruled by a despot, by a strange incredibly large man that rides around on a mobility scooter. Who knows what else this Kingdom faces, all we can do now is watch.

'gon Strongholds
----------------------
'gon Strongholds are essentially where the 'gon raiders live and do their operations. They are all usually circular in shape, and have all sorts of different buildings that have to do with building weapons and mining crystals. They are usually the color and share the aesthetic of whatever 'Gons built it. They are often situated outside a crystal farm, which looks like a circular quarry, with crystals all on the ground and sides of it. They also usually have a nearby area that is used to dock spacecraft.

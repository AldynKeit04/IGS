Polygon and Wiregon Raiding Bands
________________________________________
 After the destruction of the W2 cult, the bands of Polygon and Wiregon soldiers were simply left on the geometry, uncared by the Stadthalder. They were not reverted back to their pre-sentient phase, and just kinda sat there until they decided to go back to their geometry. Which, since they are semi sentient, and have access to some sort of weird technology that allows them to have space travel, they begin vying over crystal farms for making more weapons and vehicles and space craft. They also begin using human resources, albeit extremely rare. This causes them to start raiding each other and also humanoid space craft and space stations. This also puts them into contact with each other, and generally Wiregons and Polygons are more friendly within their own species, however they are completely hostile towards each other, and now have means to contact. Constant raids and wars are going on between them, meaning that Polygons and Wiregons are also not specific towards just Wireframes and Geometry, although the original beings are generally more prominent. Non sentient versions still roam the geometries, but some have become enslaved by their more sentient counterparts.

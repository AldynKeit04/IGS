'gon Crystals and Human Materials
------------------------------------------
As previously stated, the 'gons grow specific crystals that they can turn into things such as weapons and spacecraft. All crystals are capable of being turned into stuff like this which the 'gons use. However, they can be turned into materials which non 'gons can use. When it comes to this, each specific crystal is better for certain human materials. Red polygon crystals are useful for making most transition metals, and some post transition metals, such as aluminum, iron, tin, lead, and tungsten. Pink/magenta polygon crystals are good for making more soft and "biological" things, like various types of threads and cotton, and other such things. Red/Orange Wireframe Crystals are good for noble metals and metalloids, like gold, arsenic, silicon, and copper. Cyan is good for halogens alkali metals, nonmetals, and noble gases. It can also be synthesized into hydrogen.

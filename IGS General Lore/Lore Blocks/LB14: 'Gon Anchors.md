'Gon Anchors
-----------------------------
A 'gon Anchor is the name given to the larger 'gon spacecraft. They of course do not land on planets, and the 'gons within them usually never leave, acting as a permanent crew, only leaving for ground and air raiding parties. The Anchors are self sufficient, they essentially do everything with the crystals that they grow onboard. This includes fuel for the ships and repair. Anchors usually do not travel in fleets, they act as essentially portable space raiding strongholds, being an "anchor" for large amounts of smaller craft. They have defenses, and can defend against other Anchors, but of course couldn't stand up against an enemy fleet.

A Safe
----------------------
A Safe comes through a portal, and it lands on the piece of geometry that the Azulirians inhabit. It is retrieved and scanned, the inside a bottle of Dove™ Shampoo, the inside of the bottle being filled with dust, all of the water inside being evaporated eons ago. It is put under high security. On the side of the safe are various languages.

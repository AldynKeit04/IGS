Battlefields and Final Destinations
____________________________________
Battlefields and Final Destinations are stages that exist near geometry. They look identical to the stages which are in Smash Melee. They float around geometry, occasionally landing on said pieces of geometry, allowing polygons to go on said battlefields and fight each other. Being that there are now geometry that have both Polygons and Wiregons, they often find themselves fighting each other, the reasons for fighting varying (for glory to their beings/species, for fun, etc). When they fight, the background of the stage fades from the normal view of geometry, becoming the backgrounds which are in Melee, people in said stage only being able to see what is on the stage and the stage itself. You also hear the tracks that play in Melee. The people fighting on it inhibit all of the physics and moves from Melee, including the damage and knockback system, wavedashing and L canceling. The stage area also cannot be interacted with by people not currently engaged on it, said thing that is interacting phasing through everything, still not being perceivable by those on the stage. Around the battlefields is a K.O zone, which emits a huge blast when a player is knocked far enough away from the stage. Each time someone is knocked away from it, they respawn on a floating platform above the stage with a few seconds of invincibility. When they are knocked off 4 times, they are teleported to the nearest planet, the platform landing and letting off the victor polygon.

IGS Server and How it Relates to IGS Lore
------------------------------------------------
The IGS server is the communication realm of the IGS universe that takes form of a Discord server. Some people there have access to the rest of the IGS universe, allowing them to take part in the rest of the IGS canon as powerful and important beings. Server lore is separate from IGS lore, but those who can access the rest of the IGS universe and make server lore canon in IGS. The IGS server was created and owned by the Stadthalder, who has complete control and power over the server. The 2nd in command, Shadekyu (aka the Premier), is the 2nd most powerful in the server, being a moderator and playing a role in overall server management. The main IGS universe will be based off the actual server power structure.

Summary: The server is part of IGS as its own realm, our conversations are happening in the server lore since server lore is just the server itself. Its link to real life is what makes it difficult to comprehend, but that is unexplainable.

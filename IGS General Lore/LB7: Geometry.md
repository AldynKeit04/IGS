____________________________
The geometry is what you see floating throughout IGS space. They are named after exactly what they are; random pieces of 3D geometry. They vary in sizes and shape. There are spheres, triangular prisms rectangular prisms, cubes, etc. They are usually very large, the smallest pieces usually being the size of moons. There are some that are simply flat planes, but the 3D geometry is much more common. Another common variation are wireframe geometry, essentially the same but they are wireframe. There are special variants of the wireframe geometry which are magenta, cyan, and reddish called Synthwave worlds. There is also synthwave music constantly playing on these worlds, which you can start to hear as you get closer. This geometry also holds a variant of the polygons known as a wiregon. They have a gravitational pull, but no atmosphere. The median size around 950,000 square kilometers, however that does not mean there are mass variations in size. There are geometries which are anywhere from the size of a small village to geometries the size of entire planets, but the average and most common is this size, which would be equivalent to about 4 medium sized US States.

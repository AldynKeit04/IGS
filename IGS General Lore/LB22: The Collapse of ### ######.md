The Collapse of ### ######
---------------------------------
"Hello? Hello? Anyone out there? Hello?"

An Azulirian trader ship comes out of hyperspace and views the now completely still geometry base.
It gets closer, seeing the various ships floating freely in space, it approaches the ship, the pilot flies to the front of it, and views through the front window.

"My god, what happened? Their faces... What the fuck."

This log is the first of many similar experiences of traders visiting ### ###### trade hubs after contact completely disappeared. They found every single body within it dead and with a completely featureless face; lacking mouths, eyes, ears, etc. Their causes of death are unknown, each person apparently dying instantly where they stood. All areas which used to have symbols that denoted ### ###### no longer have said symbols. Electronic and physical records which had names remained, albeit with the names fully replaced with with the sharp character #. The names include the names of not only people, but organizations and items unique to ### ######. For the sake of the ability to say the name verbally, the name of this former group became known as "#9" or "Sharp Nine", as the original name no longer exists. All resources and assets which #9 owned still exists, gaining the interest of various different scavenging arms of trading organization, being picked clean over the course of several years. With the remaining existing infrastructure, the ruins attracted many of the less than fortunate. The area is now a mass hotspot for raiders and deals which would be illegal within a normal state, and many gons have re-established themselves on the geometry.

This is just a general idea/concept

Context events:HGNIRA and FnB have entered and are in conflict in IGS
already, this is noticed by certain groups within IGS, especially the
Stadthalder. -22 attempts to broker an alliance with the Stadthalder
but fails.
--
Three options to potentially be implemented
--
Low Franconian Army - Stadthalder is able to access and influence various 
people that speak or descendents of speakers of Franconian germanic dialects(Limburgish, Dutch, Flemish, Afrikaans) who form various
organizations in the main Universal Amalgi/where the HGNIRA and FnBC
come from, not fully sure where and how they exist

FerraCorps Army - This is essentially where the Stadthalder takes
form as a rich client who hires a ton of the FerraCorps Mercenaries to 
fight the FnBC and HGNIRA.

Combination of both - Stadthalder does both things, though with smaller 
focus on hiring FerraCorps, maybe FerraCorp making up 25-35 percent 
instead.

At the end of this war, I plan for whichever group that I pick to become so
involved in the war that bases established by these militaries eventually
become full blown civilian colonies as to support the logistics of the war.
After the end of the war, the people that colonized the area there will 
remain and form a new state.

I've created I guess a constructed dialect of Dutch, which I call "Vlak Dutch" or "Plane Dutch". This was created as a combination of Flemish, Dutch, and Afrikaans, since they will all more or less be combined. This will be the official language of the state.
I am definitely going to be using the third option. Hopefully later today, I will be able to begin work on a draft of the lore.
